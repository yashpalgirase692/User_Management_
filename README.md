## Frameworks and Language Used

- Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- Maven: A build automation tool and dependency management tool used for managing the project's dependencies and building the application.
- SpringBoot: A powerful and widely used framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides features like inversion of control, dependency injection, and seamless integration with various other libraries.

## Dataflow
* Controller : In controller class I have exposed APIs for each operation like addUser , getUser , getAllUsers , updateUserInfo and deleteUser.

* Service : In Service class I have written the logic for each of API method and return it.

* Repository : In Repository class I have acchieved dependency injection for to get list of users from the Beanfactory which is basically a configuration class.

* DataBase Design : For to store deta of users I have used Arraylist as I feel it is easy to manupulate over Arraylist.

## Data Structure

 I have used Arraylist to maintain the list of users as It is easy to manupulate over Arraylist than other deta structures.
